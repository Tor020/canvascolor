//1. Canvas gives you a chunk of pixels to work with. You're not drawing on the HTML, but you're drawing on the context get the canvas element into the canvas context
//2. ctx stands for context and we're asking the canvas for the 2d context with ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
//3. setting the canvas to occupy the window's entire width and height overriding the original defined attributes It will show that in the console if you check after setting it
//4. when you draw on something you need a color. That's the ctx.context.strokeStyle='#BADASS';
//5. lineJoin and Line cap make the lines drawn round instead of square There are a lot of different options on mdn
//6. let isDrawing is creating a flag that will turn to true when you click and when it's true it will begin drawing at your mouse's cursor and when you release the mouse it will turn false and stop drawing
//7.
